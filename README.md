# Covid-19_Analysis
A brief analysis of Covid-19 data for the first months of 2020 and World Happiness report data.

In relation to the previous repository, it was tried to look at EDA from another angle: creating a join between two sets of data and inspecting potential correlations and relationships between all variables. In this regards, a dataset containing the number Covid-19 confirmed cases since 22/01/2020 until 30/04/2020 and another dataset containing happiness criteria were joined to survey the relationships between variables. It was also tried to use different libraries and modules in python for better understanding. This routine repository can be applied for any kind of analysis for more than one dataset.

Covid-19 dataset: John Hopkins University
World happiness dataset: https://worldhappiness.report/
